### Key Conversions from React

This widget was converted from a React webapp. Key differences:

| React                      | FigJam Widget                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `<div>`                    | `<AutoLayout>`                    |
| `className`                | Inline props (fill, stroke, etc.) |
| `useState`                 | `useSyncedState`                  |
| `toast.success()`          | `figma.notify()`                  |
| CSS colors                 | RGB objects `{ r, g, b }`         |
| Drag & Drop                | onClick cycling                   |
| Spread operator `{...obj}` | `Object.assign({}, obj)`          |

### File Structure
```
Kanban ludifier/
â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json         # Widget configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json          # Dependencies and build scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ widget-src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ code.tsx         # Main widget code

â””â”€â”€ dist/
    â””â”€â”€ code.js          # Built widget (generated)
```

### Building

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build once
npm run build

# Watch mode (auto-rebuild on changes)
npm run watch
```

## Limitations

Since widgets don't support HTML UI:
- No drag-and-drop (replaced with click-to-cycle)
- No input dialogs (new issues created with default values)
- No hover effects
- Must avoid ES6+ features like spread operators

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Custom issue titles/descriptions (requires UI input alternative)
- Achievement badges
- Streak tracking
- Team leaderboards
- Export progress data
